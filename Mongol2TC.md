### Basic Opening

#### Timings
* 5:55 Deer Stones completes
* 6:15 TC Completes


#### Order
* TC villagers only
* 1 villager to Ovoo then closest of gold/food
* 5 villagers to wood, gather 50 wood then stop
* Balance economy for 4 on food, 3 on gold
* Wheelbarrow at 150 gold
* Food to 10
* Rest on Wood
* Build Deer Stones at 17 pop with 2 gold villagers, 3rd to wood
* Balance economy for 4 on food, 10 on wood, 2 on Deer Stones
* At Feudal, build Town Center with 8 villagers
* 2 Deer Stone villagers to food (6 total)

#### Optmizations
* Between the 5 wood villagers, the one making Ovoo, and the 1st produced villager you can send any of them to food/gold for the 4 food 3 gold split. Do so in the way that minimizes walking
* You will mine slightly over 200 gold depending on distance, with a far away gold you want to slightly Deer Stones start to reach 235 gold for upgrading horseman or spearmen in Feudal. This can help immensely if you are pushed off gold. You can spend some time building Deer Stones with 3 villagers if you have to wait.
