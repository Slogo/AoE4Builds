### Basic Idea
* Use Mongol's early Ger & no houses to get a fast 2nd TC
* Double Production for cheap feudal units as you go for castle
* Double Production also enables good defense vs all-ins
* Keeps Mongol economy more competitive in castle for explosive growth with Steppe Redoubt

### Common Opening

Most basic opening to the formula and the most economically greedy. This is most appropriate against boom openings or civs that have to make a production building first (Abbasid, China, Dehli, Mongol)

#### Timings
* 5:55 Deer Stones completes
* 6:15 TC Completes with 10 villagers


#### Order
* TC villagers only
* 1 villager to Ovoo then closest of gold/food
* 5 villagers to wood, gather 50 wood then stop
* Balance economy for 4 on food, 3 on gold
* Wheelbarrow at 150 gold
* Food to 10
* Rest on Wood
* Build Deer Stones at 17 pop with 3 gold villagers, 3rd to wood
* Balance economy for 4 on food, 9 on wood, 3 on Deer Stones
* At 50% move one vill on Deer Stone to Wood
* At Feudal, build Town Center with 10 villagers
* 2 Deer Stone villagers to food (6 total)

#### Optmizations
* Between the 5 wood villagers, the one making Ovoo, and the 1st produced villager you can send any of them to food/gold for the 4 food 3 gold split. Do so in the way that minimizes walking
* You can micro the villagers onto the 1st tree that is felled so they don't fell two trees. This will give you 50 wood slightly faster and keep the villagers from dropping off at different times making it a little easier. You can also use a straggler tree if it's near the TC and starting villagers.
* You will mine slightly over 200 gold depending on distance, with a far away gold you want to slightly Deer Stones start to reach 235 gold for upgrading horseman or spearmen in Feudal. This can help immensely if you are pushed off gold. You can spend some time building Deer Stones with 3 villagers if you have to wait.
* You can also just leave 2 or 3 villagers on Deer Stones. If you leave 3, move them over to wood when done. If you leave 2 then move them to food when done. By doing 3->2 feudal will complete right as you have wood for TC. With 2 or 3 for the whole duration things don't line up as well.


### Delay Wheelbarrow, Early Mangudai
* TC villagers only rally food
* Villagers gather 50 wood then food (used while TC is setting up)
* 1 villager to Ovoo then food
* 8 villagers on food
* 3 villagers on gold
* 1 villager on food (9/0/3 total)
* Rest to wood
* 4 villagers from food build deer stones -> 2 to food, 2 to ovoo for archery range then wood (7 food, 3 gold, rest wood)[2:45 start, 4:30 finish]
* Research wheelbarrow at next 150 gold after Deer Stones [~4:00 start]
* At 80 gold move 3 villagers (4 mangudai) or 2 villagers (6+ mangudai) to wood
* Double produce mangudai [5:30 for first set]
* Build TC with 10 villagers [6:40 start]
* Ramp up to 2 villagers on gold if you want constant mangudai production now otherwise hit ~22 food, then 10 gold with 4-6 on wood depending on food/map control


### Skip Wheelbarrow, Early Stables
* TC villagers only rally food
* 1 villager to Ovoo then food
* 3 villagers to wood
* 2 villagers on gold
* Stop mining gold at 200 gold (or 240) send vills to food
* 12 villagers on food, then rally wood
* Build stables at 150 wood
* Double produce horsemen (once)
* 3 from food on Age up, balance economy to either 4 or 5 food depending if you want a 2nd set of horsemen
